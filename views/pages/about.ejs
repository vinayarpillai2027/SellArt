      <p class="section-body">
        Aurora Gallery was founded with a simple belief: art should feel as considered as the spaces it
        inhabits. We collaborate directly with emerging and established artists to curate small, thoughtful
        collections that balance restraint, texture, and light.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        Every work is photographed in natural daylight and color-balanced against calibrated monitors to
        ensure what you see online is faithful to the piece that arrives at your door.
